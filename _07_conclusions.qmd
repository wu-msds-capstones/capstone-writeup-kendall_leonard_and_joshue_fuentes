# Conclusions
Our analysis shows that it is possible to identify promising MCU adaptation candidates by analyzing the narrative DNA of the comics themselves—long before production, casting, or marketing come into play. By combining the predictive strength of a constrained XGBoost classifier with the interpretability of logistic regression, we produced a composite “success potential score” that not only forecasts which comics are most likely to resonate with audiences and critics but also explains why they do.

While no model can perfectly predict adaptation success, our results reveal that certain structural and thematic patterns—such as a high number of interconnected themes, strong mentor relationships, and origin-based arcs—consistently appear in top-performing adaptations. These findings suggest a practical application for studios: using source-level metadata to guide early-stage adaptation choices, potentially increasing the likelihood of producing films and series that both honor the comics and connect with audiences.

This work has clear avenues for expansion. Future research could include more comprehensive threat and theme classifications, character-level analysis, sentiment analysis of fan discussions, and integration of movie-level factors such as production budgets and release strategies. With a more complete mapping between comics and their adaptations, the models could be further refined to capture temporal dynamics—such as which themes rise or fall in popularity over time—and to test the framework on adaptations beyond Marvel, including other publishers, book-to-film projects, or game adaptations.

Ultimately, our top recommendation—Agents of Atlas (2006) #5—is not about championing a single issue in isolation, but about demonstrating that data-driven methods can surface strong candidates and articulate the reasoning behind them. As the MCU continues to expand, pairing statistical modeling with narrative insight may help future adaptations recapture the consistency, depth, and emotional resonance that defined its earliest successes. In the end, the path to MCU success may be simple: focus on the stories and themes that have already proven their power in the comics—and the fans will follow.
