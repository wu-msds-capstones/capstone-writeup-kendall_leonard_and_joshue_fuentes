# Discussion
Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to identify promising MCU adaptation candidates by analyzing the structural and thematic DNA of the comics themselves, well before any production decisions are made. By combining the predictive strength of a constrained XGBoost model with the interpretability of logistic regression, we were able not only to forecast which comics would most likely resonate with audiences and critics but also provide a clear rationale for those predictions. The top-ranked features from both models—such as large-scale conflict, infiltration and deception, and advanced technology—align closely with the characteristics of past successful adaptations, suggesting that these traits may form part of a repeatable formula for audience engagement.

While our analysis focused on Marvel comics, the broader methodological framework has potential applications across other franchises and media formats. By quantifying the narrative elements of source material, studios and creative teams could make more informed choices about which stories to adapt, potentially increasing the likelihood of producing high-quality, commercially viable projects.

## Limitations

Despite these promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged. Our models were trained exclusively on structured metadata derived from comics, meaning that many real-world factors that influence film success—such as casting, directing, visual effects, and marketing—were intentionally excluded. This focus was deliberate, as our goal was to identify strong source material rather than to guarantee box office or critical performance. As such, the models should be interpreted as tools for flagging promising candidates for adaptation, not as predictors of a production’s ultimate success.

One significant gap in our analysis is the absence of character-level modeling. While our dataset contains extensive metadata for 1,868 unique Marvel characters, time constraints prevented us from building a dedicated pipeline to directly connect those traits—such as power sets, demographic attributes, or team affiliations—to adaptation outcomes. This omission leaves open important questions about how individual characters and their arcs contribute to the reception of an adaptation.

Our adaptation mapping process also introduces uncertainty. There is no official, comprehensive list linking individual comics to their screen adaptations, and many MCU projects draw from multiple arcs and issues. To address this, we relied on series-level classifications and aggregated fan consensus where broad agreement existed. While this approach provided reasonable coverage, it inevitably sacrifices precision and may misalign some issues with their on-screen counterparts.

Additionally, gaps in metadata affected our feature set. Some comics lacked complete theme or threat classifications, and even with our combination of keyword-based extraction and human review, subtle or context-dependent traits may have gone undetected. This is particularly true for thematic elements embedded in complex narrative descriptions, which may not always translate cleanly into Boolean features. Compounding this, all of our comic metadata came from Marvel.com, which—while authoritative—has occasional omissions, inconsistent formatting, and limited archival coverage for older material. Rotten Tomatoes ratings, though comprehensive for MCU titles, also carry potential bias from audience reviewers, whose demographics and engagement patterns may not reflect the broader population.

Finally, the models themselves carry methodological constraints. Logistic regression assumes a linear relationship between the predictors and the log-odds of the outcome, while XGBoost relies on the premise that shallow decision trees can capture the most important feature interactions. While our results suggest these assumptions were reasonable for our dataset, they inherently limit the types of relationships the models can detect. As emphasized in our Data Ethics section, these models are intended as decision-support tools rather than definitive prescriptions for adaptation choices. By grounding our features in publicly sourced metadata and using a human-in-the-loop review process for AI-assisted classifications, we aimed to reduce bias and position our outputs as informed suggestions rather than authoritative verdicts.

## Future Work
Several opportunities exist to expand and refine this research. One avenue involves experimenting with different weighting strategies for the combined XGBoost and logistic regression models. Adjusting the balance between the two could allow us to fine-tune the trade-off between predictive power and interpretability, potentially yielding an even stronger composite score.

Character-level modeling presents another significant opportunity. Building a dedicated pipeline to incorporate detailed character attributes—such as power sets, demographic traits, and team affiliations—directly into the prediction process could uncover how individual heroes or villains contribute to adaptation success. This approach might highlight recurring character archetypes or combinations that consistently perform well on screen.

Improved adaptation mapping could also strengthen our dataset. Collaborating with comic historians or carefully integrating data from fan-curated wikis could produce a more precise mapping between comics and their on-screen adaptations, reducing uncertainty in the labels that drive our model training. Enhanced feature extraction techniques, especially those using natural language processing (NLP) such as transformer-based language models, could capture narrative nuance—detecting themes, relationships, and tonal elements beyond what is possible with simple keyword matching.

Finally, expanding the scope of analysis would test the generalizability of our findings. A temporal and franchise-level analysis that includes non-MCU Marvel films or adaptations from other publishers could help determine whether the traits we identified are universal or MCU-specific. Integrating non-comic features, such as production budgets, release strategies, and marketing spend, could further improve predictive accuracy by accounting for the external factors that often influence real-world performance.

By addressing these avenues, future iterations of this work could provide a more holistic and precise toolkit for predicting and understanding adaptation success, potentially informing creative and business decisions in the film and television industry.
