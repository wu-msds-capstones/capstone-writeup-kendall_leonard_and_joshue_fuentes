# Discussion

Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to identify promising MCU adaptation candidates by analyzing the structural and thematic DNA of the comics themselves, well before any production decisions are made. By combining the predictive strength of a constrained XGBoost model with the interpretability of logistic regression, we were able to not only forecast which comics would most likely resonate with audiences and critics but also provide a clear rationale for those predictions. The top-ranked features from both models—such as large-scale conflict, infiltration and deception, and advanced technology—align closely with the characteristics of past successful adaptations, suggesting that these traits may form part of a repeatable formula for audience engagement.

While our analysis focused on Marvel comics, the broader methodological framework has potential applications across other franchises and media formats. By quantifying the narrative elements of source material, studios and creative teams could make more informed choices about which stories to adapt, potentially increasing the likelihood of producing high-quality, commercially viable projects.

## Limitations

Despite these promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged.

Scope of analysis – Our models were trained exclusively on structured metadata derived from comics, meaning that key aspects of film success, such as casting, directing, visual effects, and marketing, were not considered. While this focus was intentional, it means that the models are optimized for identifying potentially strong source material, not guaranteeing final box office or critical success.

No character-level analysis – Due to time constraints, we did not perform detailed analysis at the individual character level. While our dataset includes extensive character metadata, connecting those attributes directly to adaptation outcomes would require a separate modeling pipeline. This omission leaves open questions about how specific character arcs, identities, or interpersonal dynamics might influence adaptation success.

Incomplete adaptation mapping – There is no official, comprehensive list linking individual comics to their screen adaptations, and many MCU projects combine multiple arcs and issues. Our adaptation matching relied on series-level classifications and aggregated fan consensus, which introduces some uncertainty into the labeling of training data.

Gaps in metadata – Some comics lacked complete theme or threat classifications, and our keyword-based extraction methods—while augmented with human review—may still have missed subtle or context-dependent traits. This is particularly true for thematic elements embedded in nuanced narrative descriptions, which may not always translate cleanly into our Boolean feature set.

Bias from source coverage – All comic metadata came from Marvel.com, which, while official, has occasional omissions, inconsistent formatting, and limited archival coverage for older material. Similarly, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, while comprehensive for MCU titles, are subject to selection bias from audience reviewers.

Model assumptions – Logistic regression assumes linearity in the log-odds of the predictors, while XGBoost assumes that shallow decision trees can capture the essential feature interactions. Although our results suggest these assumptions were reasonable, they inherently limit the types of relationships our models can detect.

It is also worth noting that, as outlined in our Data Ethics section, this model is intended as a decision-support tool rather than an authoritative prescription for MCU adaptation choices. By grounding our features in publicly sourced metadata and maintaining a human-in-the-loop review process for AI-assisted classifications, we aimed to reduce bias and ensure that the final outputs serve as informed suggestions rather than definitive judgments.

## Future Work

Several opportunities exist to expand and refine this research. One avenue involves experimenting with different weighting strategies for the combined XGBoost and logistic regression models. Adjusting the balance between the two could allow us to fine-tune the trade-off between predictive power and interpretability, potentially yielding an even stronger composite score.

Character-level modeling presents another significant opportunity. Building a dedicated pipeline to incorporate detailed character attributes—such as power sets, demographic traits, and team affiliations—directly into the prediction process could uncover how individual heroes or villains contribute to adaptation success. This approach might highlight recurring character archetypes or combinations that consistently perform well on screen.

Improved adaptation mapping could also strengthen our dataset. Collaborating with comic historians or carefully integrating data from fan-curated wikis could produce a more precise mapping between comics and their on-screen adaptations, reducing uncertainty in the labels that drive our model training. Enhanced feature extraction techniques, especially those using natural language processing (NLP) such as transformer-based language models, could capture narrative nuance—detecting themes, relationships, and tonal elements beyond what is possible with simple keyword matching.

Finally, expanding the scope of analysis would test the generalizability of our findings. A temporal and franchise-level analysis that includes non-MCU Marvel films or adaptations from other publishers could help determine whether the traits we identified are universal or MCU-specific. Integrating non-comic features, such as production budgets, release strategies, and marketing spend, could further improve predictive accuracy by accounting for the external factors that often influence real-world performance.

By addressing these avenues, future iterations of this work could provide a more holistic and precise toolkit for predicting and understanding adaptation success, potentially informing creative and business decisions in the film and television industry.
