# Discussion

Our findings demonstrate that it is possible to identify promising MCU adaptation candidates by analyzing the structural and thematic DNA of the comics themselves, well before any production decisions are made. By combining the predictive strength of a constrained XGBoost model with the interpretability of logistic regression, we were able to not only forecast which comics would most likely resonate with audiences and critics but also provide a clear rationale for those predictions. The top-ranked features from both models—such as large-scale conflict, infiltration and deception, and advanced technology—align closely with the characteristics of past successful adaptations, suggesting that these traits may form part of a repeatable formula for audience engagement.

While our analysis focused on Marvel comics, the broader methodological framework has potential applications across other franchises and media formats. By quantifying the narrative elements of source material, studios and creative teams could make more informed choices about which stories to adapt, potentially increasing the likelihood of producing high-quality, commercially viable projects.

## Limitations

Despite these promising results, several limitations should be acknowledged.

Scope of analysis – Our models were trained exclusively on structured metadata derived from comics, meaning that key aspects of film success, such as casting, directing, visual effects, and marketing, were not considered. While this focus was intentional, it means that the models are optimized for identifying potentially strong source material, not guaranteeing final box office or critical success.

No character-level analysis – Due to time constraints, we did not perform detailed analysis at the individual character level. While our dataset includes extensive character metadata, connecting those attributes directly to adaptation outcomes would require a separate modeling pipeline. This omission leaves open questions about how specific character arcs, identities, or interpersonal dynamics might influence adaptation success.

Incomplete adaptation mapping – There is no official, comprehensive list linking individual comics to their screen adaptations, and many MCU projects combine multiple arcs and issues. Our adaptation matching relied on series-level classifications and aggregated fan consensus, which introduces some uncertainty into the labeling of training data.

Gaps in metadata – Some comics lacked complete theme or threat classifications, and our keyword-based extraction methods—while augmented with human review—may still have missed subtle or context-dependent traits. This is particularly true for thematic elements embedded in nuanced narrative descriptions, which may not always translate cleanly into our Boolean feature set.

Bias from source coverage – All comic metadata came from Marvel.com, which, while official, has occasional omissions, inconsistent formatting, and limited archival coverage for older material. Similarly, Rotten Tomatoes ratings, while comprehensive for MCU titles, are subject to selection bias from audience reviewers.

Model assumptions – Logistic regression assumes linearity in the log-odds of the predictors, while XGBoost assumes that shallow decision trees can capture the essential feature interactions. Although our results suggest these assumptions were reasonable, they inherently limit the types of relationships our models can detect.

It is also worth noting that, as outlined in our Data Ethics section, this model is intended as a decision-support tool rather than an authoritative prescription for MCU adaptation choices. By grounding our features in publicly sourced metadata and maintaining a human-in-the-loop review process for AI-assisted classifications, we aimed to reduce bias and ensure that the final outputs serve as informed suggestions rather than definitive judgments.

## Future Work

Several opportunities exist to expand and refine this research:

Character-level modeling – Building a dedicated pipeline to incorporate character attributes (e.g., power sets, demographic traits, team affiliations) directly into the prediction process could reveal how individual heroes or villains influence adaptation success.

Improved adaptation mapping – Collaborating with comic historians or leveraging fan-curated wikis could produce a more precise mapping of comics to their on-screen adaptations, reducing uncertainty in labels.

Enhanced feature extraction – Using natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as transformer-based language models, could allow for more nuanced detection of themes, relationships, and tone beyond simple keyword matching.

Temporal and franchise-level analysis – Expanding the dataset to include non-MCU Marvel films or even adaptations from other publishers could help test whether the identified traits are universal or MCU-specific.

Integration of non-comic features – Incorporating production-level data (e.g., budget, release strategy, marketing spend) alongside comic features could improve predictive accuracy for real-world performance.

By addressing these avenues, future iterations of this work could provide a more holistic and precise toolkit for predicting and understanding adaptation success, potentially informing creative and business decisions in the film and television industry.
