# Data
## Sources
The data for this project originates from three primary sources: the official Marvel website (Marvel.com), Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. While several additional sources were considered during the early stages of the project, they were ultimately dismissed due to inconsistent formatting, limited access, or unreliable metadata. These decisions are discussed in more detail in the Limitations section.

Because our objective is to identify which Marvel characters and storylines are most likely to succeed when adapted into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), we first had to define what “success” means. Initially, we considered using box office revenue as a proxy. However, this metric is not available for Marvel TV shows, especially those hosted on streaming platforms like Disney+. As a result, we pivoted to using aggregated ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, which measure how well both critics and general audiences received a particular movie or show. Ratings allow for comparisons across both film and television and offer a more complete picture of how adaptations are received.

Rotten Tomatoes was selected as our primary source for critical and audience response data. It offers public access to both critic and audience scores, and it includes a verified audience score that draws only from users who purchased tickets. While all review aggregators are subject to response bias (e.g., users are more likely to leave reviews when they are extremely satisfied or dissatisfied), Rotten Tomatoes mitigates this through its aggregation methodology and verification features. Its inclusion of both theatrical and streaming content, combined with the availability of consistent data for all MCU productions, made it an ideal fit for this project.

Marvel.com served as the primary source for comic and character data. As the official home of Marvel’s online catalog, the site includes comprehensive information about characters, issues, story arcs, powers, and team affiliations. Although Marvel does offer a public developer API, it has not been actively maintained since 2014. Many endpoints were broken or returned incomplete or incorrect data, forcing us to shift to a custom web scraping approach. While Marvel.com contains additional data we were unable to capture due to time and software constraints, we focused on the characters and comics components as they directly relate to our project’s central research question.

IMDb was used to identify which comic characters had already appeared in the MCU. We scraped cast and character listings for every MCU movie and TV show to create an in_movie flag, linking comic metadata to real-world adaptation outcomes. This allowed us to connect character popularity and storyline complexity with on-screen representation—an essential component of our success metric.

While our project uses publicly available data, we considered several ethical concerns. First, character metadata may reflect historical biases in comic publishing—e.g., underrepresentation of women and BIPOC characters—which could skew model outputs. We chose not to use race or gender as predictors in our adaptation models to avoid reinforcing such biases.

Additionally, we excluded fan-edited wikis or Reddit data due to concerns about data quality, consent, and citation. Only official or structured third-party sources (IMDb, Marvel.com, Rotten Tomatoes) were used.

## Organization

### Entity Relationship Diagram

To support the complexity of our classification and prediction tasks, we designed a comprehensive relational database schema that captures character traits, comic metadata, adaptation linkages, and auxiliary attributes across over 20 interrelated tables. The schema integrates many-to-many bridge tables and normalized dimensions to preserve data integrity and analytic flexibility. Below, we provide an interactive entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that visualizes the structure of our database, allowing readers to explore table-level details dynamically.

## Dictionaries
To provide further clarity on the structure and contents of our database, we include brief data dictionaries for a subset of central tables that play a critical role in our analysis—particularly those related to characters, comics, and MCU adaptations. These summaries define key variables and their relationships, supporting the reader’s understanding of the modeling pipeline. For a complete listing of auxiliary tables, including bridge and lookup dimensions (e.g., comic_themes, hero_to_alias, and locations), see the extended documentation in the Appendix.
