# Data
Our project draws on a combination of original web-scraped datasets and curated external resources, each chosen to capture a different dimension of the Marvel-to-MCU adaptation pipeline. Together, these sources provide the foundation for both our exploratory analysis and our modeling efforts. The following sections outline each source in detail, describing what information it contains and why it was essential for answering our research question.

## Sources
The data for this project originates from three primary sources: the official Marvel website (Marvel.com), Rotten Tomatoes, and IMDb. While several additional sources were considered, such as Marvel’s official API and Kaggle, during the early stages of the project, they were ultimately dismissed due to inconsistent formatting, limited access, or unreliable metadata.

Because our objective is to identify which Marvel characters and storylines are most likely to succeed when adapted into the MCU, we first had to define what “success” means. Initially, we considered using box office revenue as a proxy. However, in the era of streaming, box office earnings no longer carry the same weight they once did—particularly for franchises like the MCU, where major releases are increasingly supplemented by Disney+ series and direct-to-streaming projects. This shift makes box office earnings an incomplete and sometimes misleading measure of success.  Additionally, box-office earnings are not available for Marvel TV shows, especially those hosted on streaming platforms like Disney+.  As a result, we pivoted to using aggregated ratings from Rotten Tomatoes, which measure how well both critics and general audiences received a particular movie or show. Ratings allow for comparisons across both film and television and offer a more complete picture of how adaptations are received. After all, people can buy a ticket to a movie and not like it.

Rotten Tomatoes was selected as our primary source for critical and audience response data. It offers public access to both critic and audience scores, and it includes a verified audience score that draws only from users who purchased tickets. While all review aggregators are subject to response bias (e.g., users are more likely to leave reviews when they are extremely satisfied or dissatisfied), Rotten Tomatoes mitigates this through its aggregation methodology and verification features. Its inclusion of both theatrical and streaming content, combined with the availability of consistent data for all MCU productions, made it an ideal fit for this project.

Marvel.com served as the primary source for comic and character data. As the official home of Marvel’s online catalog, the site includes comprehensive information about characters, comic book issues, story arcs, powers, and team affiliations. Although Marvel does offer a public developer API, it has not been actively maintained since 2014. Many endpoints were broken or returned incomplete or incorrect data, forcing us to shift to a custom web scraping approach. While Marvel.com contains additional relevant data that we were unable to capture due to time and software constraints, we thus focused on the characters and comics components as they directly relate to our project’s central research question.

Lastly, IMDb was used to identify which comic characters had already appeared in the MCU. We scraped cast and character listings for every MCU movie and TV show to create an in-movie flag, linking comic metadata to real-world adaptation outcomes. This allowed us to connect character popularity and storyline complexity with on-screen representation—an essential component of our success metric.

## Organization
Before diving into the specific tables and relationships, it is vital to understand how the project’s data sources fit together. Our dataset integrates multiple streams of information—comic metadata, character details, MCU adaptation data, and audience/critic reception—into a unified relational structure. This organization ensures that raw scraped fields and engineered features can be linked seamlessly across sources, supporting both descriptive analysis and predictive modeling. The interactive Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) below illustrates how these components connect in our database.


### Entity Relationship Diagram
To support the complexity of our classification and prediction tasks, we designed a comprehensive relational database schema that captures character traits, comic metadata, adaptation linkages, and auxiliary attributes across over 20 interrelated tables, with a final count of 26. The schema integrates many-to-many bridge tables and normalized dimensions to preserve data integrity and analytic flexibility. Below, we provide an interactive entity-relationship diagram (ERD) that visualizes the structure of our database, allowing readers to explore table-level details dynamically.

## Dictionaries
To provide further clarity on the structure and contents of our database, we include brief data dictionaries for a subset of central tables that play a critical role in our analysis—particularly those related to characters, comics, and MCU adaptations. These summaries define key variables and their relationships, supporting the reader’s understanding of the modeling pipeline. For a complete listing of auxiliary tables, including bridge and lookup dimensions (e.g., comic_themes, hero_to_alias, and locations), see the extended documentation in the Appendix.
